Arnold Sommerfeld (c.1950) when asked why he had never written a book on thermodynamics:<br>
"Thermodynamics is a funny subject. The first time you go through it, you don't understand it at all. The second time you go through it, you think you understand it, except for one or two small points. The third time you go through it, you know you don't understand it, but by that time you are so used to it, it doesn't bother you anymore."<br><br>

Gyan on meetings: <br>
"Meetings are where minutes are kept and hours are lost" <br><br>

Colleague to grad student: <br>
"It is an admirable thing to want to do things on your own, but it even more admirable to know when to ask for help" <br><br>
