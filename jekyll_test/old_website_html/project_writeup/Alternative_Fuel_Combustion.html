<h2>Abstract</h2>

Renewable and alternative fuels for aviation have advantages of lesser emissions and clean burning ability. This project involves modeling the oxidation of these fuels using a representative mixture. Theoretical in nature, the research focus is on identifying such a suitable mixture and arriving at a kinetic scheme to predict the fuel's combustion behavior from a fundamental approach. This opens up avenues to study several `drop-in alternatives' to current day aviation fuels.
