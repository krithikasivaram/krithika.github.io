	<h3> Automatic mechanism generation </h3> 
	<!-- <h3> Category: M.S (can be extended to a PhD) </h3> -->

Codes to generate mechanisms for any hydrocarbon fuel. Some existing codes do this -- can we do better?
<!-- <a "" >More to read on ... </a>. -->

	<h3> Simulation driven surrogate formulation </h3> 
	<!-- <h3> Category: M.S (can be extended to a PhD) </h3> -->

Can simulations be used to define surrogates (representative mixtures) for real fuels? We have made some progress on this along with a preliminary code development exercise -- can this be more flexible and meaningful is the question ...

<td width="100%">
	<h3> Solver for homogeneous reactors </h3> 
	<!-- <h3> Category: M.S (can be extended to a PhD) </h3> -->

Homogenous reactor configurations are often used to validate kinetic models. The objective is to develop a stand alone in-house solver for simulating these configurations.

<tr>
<td width="100%">
	<h3> Analysis tools </h3> 
	<!-- <h3> Category: M.S (can be extended to a PhD) </h3> -->

Path flux analysis (through which paths does the reaction system evolve the most) is commonly used in kinetic model development. The aim is to develop a GUI based interface to ease this analysis.

	<h3> Kinetics of butyl cyclohexane </h3> 
	<!-- <h3> Category: M.S (can be extended to a PhD) </h3> -->

What is the importance of cycloakane representatives in real fuel surrogates? The aim is to investigate two cyclohexanes -- {\it n}-butylcyclohexane and methylcyclohexane and explore their role as real fuel surrogates.
