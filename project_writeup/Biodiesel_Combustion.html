<h2>Abstract</h2>

Biodiesel is being increasingly used in combination with diesel fuel in CI engines because of being renewable and resulting in reduced emissions. This project focuses on a fundamental study to identify the importance of different constituents in biodiesel and develop a kinetic model to describe its oxidation. This opens up options to study blends of biodiesel with diesel fuel as well. 

<h2>Pre-requisite</h2>

Strong desire to pick up combustion kinetics concepts (no prior familiarity is required)
