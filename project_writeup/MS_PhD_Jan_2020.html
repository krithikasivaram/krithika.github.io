	<center><h3> 1. Bottom-up approach to kinetic modeling of larger hydrocarbons </h3> </center>
		
<body bgcolor = "black">
<h3>Abstract</h3>

<!-- One of the two topics will be the object of study:

<h3> Alternative Fuel combustion </h3>
Renewable and alternative fuels for aviation have advantages of lesser emissions and clean burning ability. This project involves modeling the oxidation of these fuels using a representative mixture. Theoretical in nature, the research focus is on identifying such a suitable mixture and arriving at a kinetic scheme to predict the fuel's combustion behavior from a fundamental approach. This opens up avenues to study several `drop-in alternatives' to current day aviation fuels.

-->

A bottom-up approach to compact model development has been put forth in one of our recent works to successfully develop a 23 species model for dimethylether. How can this be extended to higher hydrocarbons? A major challenge in adopting this methodology for higher hydrocarbons is the development of the fuel specific sub-mechanism. To begin with, the student will use the approach to develop the kinetics of a small molecule and thereafter investigate how to extend the approach.

<h3>Pre-requisite</h3>

Penchant for writing stand-alone codes, ability to learn new ideas, and interest in combustion. The applicant must be GATE qualified, and must be selected by the MS admission process at IIT Madras.

	<center><h3> 2. Experiments in Botha and Spalding burner </h3> </center>
		
<body bgcolor = "black">
<h3>Abstract</h3>

To measure burning speeds of adiabatic freely propagating flames, Botha and Spalding burner (1956) was used. This project aims to find if the experimental technique can be improved and can thus enable accurate measurements without cumbersome heating arrangements presently used in the combustion community. Some preliminary results have been obtained in a M. Tech project centered on this topic. This work will involve experimental as well as computational components, and will be jointly advised by <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/info/fac/varuns" target="_blank">Dr. Varunkumar</a> at IITM.

<h3>Pre-requisite</h3>

Prior hands on experimental experience is a plus point. Ability to learn new ideas and interest in combustion is a must. The applicant must be GATE qualified, and must be selected by the MS admission process at IIT Madras.
