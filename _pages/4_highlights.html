  <br> An alternative way to formulate transportation fuels surrogates using model predictions of gas-phase combustion targets is explored and compared to conventional approaches. This study suggests that in a computational modeling context, surrogate compositions should be determined not just based on global characteristics, as has been done so far, but also on the characteristics and predictive capabilities of the chemical kinetic
  mechanism used for the simulations. </center>

  <br> An accurate, fast, direct and robust algorithm to compute multi-component diffusion velocities has been proposed. To our knowledge, this is the  first provably accurate algorithm scaling at a computational complexity of O(N) in  nite precision. The above figure compares the total time taken by our proposed fast algorithm to compute diffusion velocities versus the total time taken by the iterative biconjugate gradient method. </center>

  <br> <p style="text-align:left;"> A flexible and evolutive component library framework has been proposed to derive short chemical mechanisms with only the necessary kinetics for the desired surrogate mixture. Figure showd the chemical model developed  our earlier works reorganized into this framework. A script to extract a chemical mechanism for a surrogate mixture, the kinetics of whose individual components are described in this parent chemical mechanism, is available under the tab <i> publications</i> </p> </center>

  <br> <p style="text-align:left;">  Ignition delay times of JP-8/Jet-A fuels at stoichiometric fuel/air equivalence ratios: Symbols - experimental data from several sources. Simulations are performed by representing the real jet fuel as a surrogate containing 30.3% n-dodecane, 21.2% m-xylene, and 48.5% methylcyclohexane (mole %). The kinetics of this surrogate mixture are extracted from a multi-component reaction mechanism using the component library approach.  </center>
